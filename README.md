# Educational Game about Iceland
Final project for my advanced writing class
## How to run
The first step in running my game is downloading all the files from this Git Hub repo. You can do that by clicking on the green "Code" button, and then download it as a zip file <br>
Once you have extracted the files and have the main folder titled "Iceland game" you are ready to proceed. 
### Installing PyGame
This game uses the library pygame. The easiest way to install it using python is by running the command 
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame
```
This will install the library, but the game uses some experimental features so you will need to upgrade pygame once it is installed. Do this by running 
```
python3 -m pip install pygame --upgrade
```
This should upgrade pygame to the most recent version, which is required. <br>
From there you can run the main.py file which starts the game.
